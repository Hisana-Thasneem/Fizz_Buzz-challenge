# Fizz_Buzz-challenge

This is my first FISS BUZZ challenge in php. FizzBuzz challenge is defined below:
Print integers 1 to N, but print “Fizz” if an integer is divisible by 3, “Buzz” if an integer is divisible by 5, and “FizzBuzz” if an integer is divisible by both 3 and 5.
This program is implemented using nested loops ie if loop under for loop.
